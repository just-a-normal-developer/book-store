# book-store
I worked on a book-store project to learn Django and reviewed the parts I had learned.
In this site we have render base site and did'nt use drf(django rest framework ) .

all in all if you just started to learn the Django , this project will help you to understand some points like : class based views and functional views i wrote them beside eachother so you can compare them
