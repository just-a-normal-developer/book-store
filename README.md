# book-store
I worked on a book-store project to learn Django and reviewed the parts I had learned.
In this site we have render base site and did'nt use any api's .

all in all if you just started to learn the Django this project will help you to understand some points like : class based views and functional views i wrote them beside eachother so you can compare them 
If you have any suggestion that think can help to improve the project i would be happy to hear it 
good luck
